\titleAndDate{ML Classifier on an FPGA SoC with High-level Synthesis (Vivado Toolchain)}{January 2024 - March 2024}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
    \item\normalText{Implemented a highly parallel streaming-based Support Vector Machine with DMA, hierarchical pipelining, optimised hyperparameter storage layout, precision tuning and CORDIC for exponential approximation.}
    \item\normalText{Achieved the lowest latency of any Computing group by employing systematic benchmarking and analysis to target bottlenecks.}
\end{itemize}

\titleAndDate{WACC - Compiler in Rust}{January 2022 - March 2022}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
    \item\normalText{Wrote an efficient and memory-safe 7-stage optimizing compiler. }
    \item\normalText{Designed and implemented the four compiler stages for graph coloring register allocation, dramatically increasing execution speed of compiled executables through minimizing stack use; only group in the cohort to successfully implement.}
    \item\normalText{Created an extensible regression integration testing framework in Bash. }
\end{itemize}

\titleAndDate{Pintos - Operating System in C}{October 2021 - December 2021}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
    \item\normalText{Various kernel extensions including schedulers, user processes/program facilitation, system calls, virtual memory with paging. }
    \item\normalText{Honed my design skills by creating the full virtual memory architecture, enabling productive delegation to different team members and execution. Additionally allowing me to crisis manage when two of four group members experienced burnout. }
    \item\normalText{Designed a fine-grained concurrent solution allowing shared access of global virtual memory resources by different user processes. }
\end{itemize}
