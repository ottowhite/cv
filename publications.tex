	\item\normalText{Enabled high-performance, fine-grained access control at the cloud-scale with capability-based security, demonstrating capabilities as a promising access control approach for disaggregated cloud architectures.}
	\item\normalText{Explored decentralisation, sharding, and efficient distributed garbage collection; the first work on capability systems to achieve scalability, fault-tolerance and $\mu$s-scale access control operations simultaneously.}
	\item\normalText{Published in collaboration with Imperial College London, Microsoft and Intel in the first 6 months of the PhD.}
    % \item\normalText{Scaled capabilities beyond previous works, innovating on resource-efficient distributed garbage collection. }
